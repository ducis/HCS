Module "IEE1"      (bean IntEEPROM)
   - IEE1_SetByte -This method writes a given byte to a specified address in EEPROM. The method also sets address pointer for 
                <SetActByte> and <GetActByte> methods (applicable only if these methods are enabled). The pointer is set to 
                address passed as the parameter.
   - IEE1_GetByte -This method reads a byte from a specified EEPROM address. The method also sets address pointer for 
                <SetActByte> and <GetActByte> methods (applicable only if these methods are enabled). The pointer is set to 
                address passed as the parameter.

Module "AS1"       (bean AsynchroSerial)
   - AS1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read. Version specific 
                information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU 
                and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then this method only sets the selected DMA channel. Then 
                the status of the DMA transfer can be checked using GetCharsInRxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage 
                for details about the communication using DMA.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the bean is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar method 
                only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be stored. 
                Enabling the bean (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is available only if 
                the transmitter property is enabled.  Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:
                If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured to use DMA controller then 
                this method only sets selected DMA channel. Then the status of the DMA transfer can be checked using 
                GetCharsInTxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage for details about communication using DMA.
   - AS1_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental error), 
                otherwise it returns an error code (it does not wait for data).  This method is available only if non-zero 
                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters. Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  
                If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then 
                this method only sets the selected DMA channel. Then the status of the DMA transfer can be checked using 
                GetCharsInRxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage for details about communication using DMA.
   - AS1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output 
                buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.  Version specific information for Freescale 56800 
                derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured 
                to use DMA controller then this method only sets the selected DMA channel. Then the status of the DMA transfer 
                can be checked using GetCharsInTxBuf method. See typical usage for details about communication using DMA.
   - AS1_ClearRxBuf -Clears the receive buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the input buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled. Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   
                DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the receiver is configured to use DMA 
                controller then this method only stops selected DMA channel.
   - AS1_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled. Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   
                DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured to use DMA 
                controller then this method only stops selected DMA channel.
   - AS1_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled. Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA 
                controller is available on the selected CPU and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then this 
                method returns the number of characters in the receive buffer.
   - AS1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled. Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If 
                DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured to use DMA controller then 
                this method returns the number of characters in the transmit buffer.

Module "Cpu"       (bean MC9S12XS256_80)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_SetWaitMode -Set low power mode - Wait mode.  For more information about the wait mode see documentation of this CPU.  
                Release from Wait mode: Reset or interrupt
   - Cpu_SetStopMode -Set low power mode - Stop mode.  For more information about the stop mode see documentation of this CPU.
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
